            <h2>Sustainability in Smart Cities</h2>
            <p>Sustainability is at the core of smart city development, with the aim of creating environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and resource-conserving urban environments. By utilizing advanced technology and data analytics, cities are adopting strategies that reduce carbon footprints and enhance the quality of life for their residents. Here are the key areas where smart cities are driving sustainability:</p>
            
            <!-- Subsections with more specific content -->
            <article>
                <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
                <p>Smart buildings and infrastructure in cities utilize cutting-edge technology to optimize energy use. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are integrated into the grid to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Smart buildings are equipped with energy-efficient HVAC systems, solar panels, and advanced insulation, which significantly reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, smart lighting systems automatically adjust brightness based on real-time environmental conditions, reducing electricity consumption and costs.</p>

                <h3>Waste Management</h3>
                <p>Smart waste management systems use IoT-enabled sensors to monitor trash levels in bins and dumpsters. This data is sent to municipal waste management services to optimize the collection schedules and routes, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing truck traffic. Additionally, sensors help track the type and quantity of waste to ensure more effective recycling. Cities are also implementing waste-to-energy technologies that convert non-recyclable waste into usable energy.</p>
                
                <h4>Key Approaches to Waste Management:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart Bins:</strong> Waste bins with sensors to detect when they are full and send notifications for collection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recycling Programs:</strong> Enhanced sorting of recyclable materials through automated systems in smart bins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste-to-Energy:</strong> Converting non-recyclable waste into electricity or heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven Collection:</strong> Optimizing collection routes and schedules through data analytics to reduce emissions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
                <p>With water becoming an increasingly scarce resource, smart cities are taking proactive measures to conserve and manage water usage. Rainwater harvesting systems are being implemented in urban areas to capture and store rainwater for non-potable uses like irrigation and cooling. Additionally, IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems automatically adjust water use based on weather patterns and soil moisture levels, ensuring that water is used efficiently and only when necessary.</p>
                
                <h4>Key Water Conservation Strategies:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting:</strong> Collecting and storing rainwater for irrigation and other non-potable purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart Irrigation Systems:</strong> Using sensors and weather forecasts to optimize water usage for landscaping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Leak Detection:</strong> Implementing IoT sensors in water pipes to detect leaks early and prevent wastage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Recycling:</strong> Reusing greywater from households for non-potable uses, reducing overall water demand.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Green Spaces and Urban Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Incorporating green spaces within urban areas is crucial for improving air quality, providing recreational spaces, and supporting biodiversity. Urban farming and community gardens are growing trends in smart cities, allowing residents to grow their own food locally. These initiatives help reduce the environmental impact of food transportation and promote healthier lifestyles.</p>
                
                <h4>Benefits of Green Spaces:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Air Quality Improvement:</strong> Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to mitigate pollution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity Support:</strong> Urban green spaces provide habitats for birds, insects, and other wildlife.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> Green roofs and walls reduce the urban heat island effect, keeping cities cooler.</li>
