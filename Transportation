        <h2>Transportation in Smart Cities</h2>
        <p>Efficient, clean, and innovative transportation systems are key to building smart cities. Here's how smart transportation solutions are improving mobility and reducing environmental impact:</p>

        <h3>Smart Public Transport</h3>
        <p>Modern cities are adopting **real-time tracking** systems for buses, trains, and trams, allowing commuters to check live arrival times and avoid overcrowding. **Electric buses** and **autonomous vehicles** are becoming increasingly popular as part of the move towards zero-emission public transportation.</p>

        <h3>Electric and Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
        <p>Smart cities are integrating **electric vehicles (EVs)** into their transport networks, including **autonomous cars** that reduce the need for human drivers. This reduces emissions, improves traffic flow, and makes transportation more efficient.</p>
        
        <a href="electricvehicles.html">
            <button> Electric Vehicles</button>
        </a>
        
        <div id="ev-info" style="display:none;">
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are vehicles that run entirely on electricity, typically powered by batteries. In smart cities, EV charging stations are strategically located, and vehicles are integrated into a connected network that optimizes traffic management and energy use.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sustainable Transport: Bike-Sharing and Car-Sharing</h3>
        <p>To reduce traffic congestion and pollution, cities are implementing **bike-sharing programs** and **car-sharing systems**. These solutions promote **sustainable commuting** and reduce the number of private cars on the road, making cities more walkable and bike-friendly.</p>

        <a href="bikesharing.html">
            <button> Bike-Sharing</button>
        </a>        
        <div id="bike-share-info" style="display:none;">
            <p>Bike-sharing programs allow people to rent bikes for short trips around the city. These programs reduce traffic congestion, promote exercise, and are an environmentally-friendly alternative to driving. Bikes are typically available at docking stations throughout the city, and users can pick them up and drop them off at different locations.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Intelligent Traffic Management</h3>
        <p>Smart cities use **AI-powered traffic management systems** to reduce congestion. These systems collect real-time data from sensors and traffic cameras, adjusting traffic light patterns based on traffic flow. In addition, cities are implementing **smart parking** solutions that guide drivers to available parking spaces in real time.</p>

        <h3>Integrated Mobility Platforms</h3>
        <p>To further optimize transportation, many smart cities offer **mobility-as-a-service (MaaS)** platforms, which integrate public transport, bike-sharing, car rentals, and more into a single app. This allows users to plan their journeys, pay for tickets, and receive updates, all from a single platform.</p>
        
        <a href="Mobility-as-a-Service.html">
            <button> MaaS (Mobility-as-a-Service)</button>
        </a>    
        <div id="maas-info" style="display:none;">
            <p>Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms bring together various transportation services such as buses, trains, taxis, and shared vehicles into one seamless app. Users can access these services based on their travel needs, and pay through a single payment system, making transportation more convenient and sustainable.</p>
